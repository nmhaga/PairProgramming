Problem C
---------

Today's problem will be entirely git based, just to get everyone who may have missed a session or two back up to speed. 

The task is to make a file in the folder, and then share that change with your partner. 
They must then make a change in the file and share the change back, both using pull requests in Github. 

Make sure you use Chrome or Chromium, as our old version of Firefox is not supported by GitHub!
